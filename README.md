## About Me

I am a former software engineer and currently run a programming school in Japan.  
After working in real development environments, I now focus on **education and technical writing**, especially explaining complex backend topics in a clear and practical way.

## Main Activities

- Technical blogging (backend-focused)
- Programming education
- Creating practical sample code for learners

## Technical Focus

- **Java**: basic structure, naming conventions, Streams API, backend design
- **Python**: modern environment setup (uv), package management, practical usage
- **PHP**: secure database access (PDO), performance and best practices

## Technical Blog

I run a technical blog called **「コードの泉 (Code-Izumi)」**, where I publish detailed explanations, troubleshooting guides, and implementation-focused articles.

## Sample Codes

All actual source codes used in the blog articles are published in the following repository:

## External Writing

I also share technical knowledge on global platforms such as DEV.to and Hashnode.
